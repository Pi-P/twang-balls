### Today or tomorrow could be the same as yesterday, OR TTSY.
By way of another I say "farm-trout".  After the big event, CronkD provided play by play details to all but not those who can not be all. For those, CronkD offered one of many that did not belong but may be available next Tuesday.  

- TTSY is similar to Y
- Special attention is given to the quadlets and fritzrskis
- Reversal and wag sets are driven to 5*v(rxy)
- Daytime can become mostly light by 0.3%
- Variations of Y are newest after TTS
- Donkey-shire
